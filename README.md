3D-Printed Housing:
To print the housing, download the STL files for the lid, "NLid.stl" for prototype 1 and "NLid2.stl" for prototype 2, and base, "NBase2.stl" for prototype 1 and "NBase2.stl". Import them into a 3D printing slicer, such as the Prusa Slicer (https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/). Once imported, selected the type of filament, which is Generic PLA, and the type of printer being used. For this project, we used a Prusa MK3S+ 3D printer. Select the option to add a brim. The rest of the settings in the slicer should remain the same. Slice the file, generate the gcode for the file, and then export the gcode from the slicer to the SD card of the 3D printer. The files should now be ready for printing.
